# Config, storage & API reference

Relational config tables, the per-resource config REST, backup/restore, node monitoring, and the REST endpoint summary (`s.routes()` in `internal/api/server.go` is authoritative).

## Config management (web UI)

The sidebar has **Bots** / **Repeater** / **MQTT** (Comms) and **Settings**
(System) plus add/edit/delete on the Companions page (the chat header's
"edit" action deep-links there via `?edit=<name>`). Each edits **one resource** through
the per-resource config REST (`/api/config/*`): pages fetch only the slice
they need (`hooks/useApiObject` for single-row settings/mqtt, `hooks/useApiList`
for the lists) and write through `lib/configApi.ts`. There is **no
whole-document fetch or PUT** — the old `GET/PUT /api/config` (and
`hooks/useConfig.ts`) were removed because the GET shipped every secret to the
browser. Read DTOs are **secret-redacted** (`privateKeySet` / `passwordSet` /
`modemTokenSet` booleans); a write **omits** a secret field to keep the stored
value, sends it to set, sends `""` to clear. The openHop modem token is one of
these: it lives in `settings.modem_token`, never inside the connection string,
because `GET /api/config/settings` returns that string in full.

Server-side, every write goes through `backend.configMutate`
(`internal/app/config_rest.go`): inside one `WriteSync` it loads the current
row snapshot (`configRows`), applies the change in memory, **assembles +
`Validate()`s the whole config BEFORE persisting** (by surrogate id), then
reloads. So an invalid edit is rejected before it touches the DB, and a
rename/key-rotation keeps the row's id. Reloads are diff-based
(`reloadCompanions` in `internal/app/app.go`): only companions whose
*effective* block changed are restarted — unchanged ones keep running,
sessions intact, no re-advert; log-level changes apply with zero restarts. A
radio/connection change still restarts everything (modem reconnect);
`listenAddr` needs a process restart.

- **Local sensors are not config.** `sensors` (provider, kind, name, options
  JSON, bindings JSON; the name unique ignoring case), `sensor_state` (one row per
  sensor: what a part like the BME680 has learned, replaced in place) and
  `telemetry_map` (per node: `node_kind`, `node_id`, channel, LPP type, sensor and
  metric; unique on node, channel and type) live outside `config.Config` and
  bypass `configMutate`. `node_kind` and the three `telem_*` columns are CHECKed
  to their few values.
  Sensor and map writes go through `internal/app/sensors.go` and
  `telemetry_map.go`, which hold `sensorWrites` from their checks to the hub
  reload so racing requests cannot each pass the checks the other breaks.
  The `radio` provider reads the board's battery and MCU temperature from what
  the liveness probe already cached (`liveRadio` in `internal/app/sensors.go`),
  so it adds no link traffic. Each reading (battery, MCU temperature, noise
  floor, board sensors) goes stale and is timed by its own query's last answer,
  never by the board answering something else, an error reply included; the
  battery and MCU pair is as old as the older of the two. A 0 mV battery (the
  firmware's "not supported") reads 0 V, as the firmware sends it. SPI has no
  board, so the provider is unavailable there. On KISS the same 30 s poll also
  sends `GET_SENSORS` with the environment permission and keeps the decoded
  LPP; each channel the board reports is a `radio-board-sensor` (option
  `channel`, 2 to 255, one sensor per channel), reading in the I2C drivers'
  metrics and units where the LPP type names one. A generic sensor value has no
  unit, so a board BME680's gas is a unitless `generic_sensor`: the firmware
  puts the gas resistance there, or the IAQ index on a BSEC build, and nothing
  on the wire says which. A new map row may only pick what that channel reads
  now (any board metric while it reads nothing); a saved row, and an edit that
  takes nothing away, are not held to what it reads now. The firmware numbers
  board channels in the order its sensors started, so one that fails to start
  moves the next onto its channel: each board sensor records the metrics its
  channel first read (`sensor_state`, as `channel:metrics`) and, while the
  channel reads another set, reads nothing and says so rather than read
  another part. Moving it to another channel records afresh; after rewiring
  the board, delete its board sensors and add them again. Position is not
  asked for, and openHop has no sensors command.
  `companions.telem_base/loc/env` hold who may read each telemetry class
  (`deny`, `selected`, `contacts`), written only by
  `PUT /api/config/companions/{id}/telemetry`, so every other companion edit
  carries them through. `companions.app_enabled`, `app_port` and
  `app_queue_size` are the MeshCore app's TCP access (see
  [firmware-protocol.md](./firmware-protocol.md)), written only by
  `PUT /api/config/companions/{id}/app`; the port is 5000-5015, kept while
  access is off, and unique among companions with access on.
  `app_queue` holds the message frames the app has yet to sync (the firmware's
  offline queue): up to `app_queue_size` per companion (16-10000, default 256,
  most firmware builds' `OFFLINE_QUEUE_SIZE`), the oldest channel messages
  dropped first, or the new message when only DMs fill it. A new size applies
  on the next message without reopening the port; DMs past a lowered size stay
  until the app syncs them. A trigger empties it when access goes off. The map keys on node kind and id with no foreign key
  (a row may be the repeater's), so deleting a companion or the repeater deletes
  its rows, and a pruned backup drops rows whose node is gone.
- **Config is stored relationally** (the config tables: `settings`,
  `mqtt_settings`, `mqtt_brokers`, `companions`, `companion_channels`,
  `triggers`, `trigger_channels` — all with surrogate INTEGER ids so name /
  pubkey / private_key are mutable columns nothing references). The
  assemble/disassemble seam between these rows and the in-memory
  `*config.Config` the runtime consumes lives in `internal/app/config_tables.go`
  (`loadConfigRows` → `assembleFromRows`; `writeConfigToTables` disassembles).
  The legacy `app_config` JSON blob table is **dormant**: the baseline schema
  still creates it, but `initConfigTables` reads it only on a never-initialized
  DB (no `settings` row) to import a pre-relational blob, and no live DB has one
  left to import.
- **The database is the source of truth.** Config files are one-time imports
  (`internal/app/config.go` `resolveConfig`): an explicit `-config path` flag
  imports and **overwrites** the stored config; otherwise the DB wins; a first
  run imports a default-named file from the cwd or bootstraps a quiet default
  (zero companions — the first-run wizard creates one). SIGHUP reloads from
  the DB.
- **Legacy config-file format is import-compatible.** The pre-relational ("main"
  deployment) format used `nodeType`, `[[bot]]`/`[[bot.trigger]]`, and
  `[[observer]]`/`[observer.broker]`; `migrateLegacyFormat` (in
  `internal/config/legacy.go`, run first in `ApplyDefaults`) folds those into
  `connectionType` / `[[companion]]` / a single top-level `[mqtt]` so an
  existing deployed config imports without dropping the bot or MQTT feed. A
  bot and an observer **sharing a name are the same node**: the observer is
  matched to that companion (else a companion is created), its `keyFile` seed
  becomes the companion's identity (via the `KeyFile`→`PrivateKey`
  `MigrateKeyFiles` path) and its `[advert]` its position. Legacy broker
  `ws`/`wss` transports normalize to `websockets` (`wss` implies TLS); the
  canonical schema and `BrokerConfig.Validate` only know `tcp`/`websockets`.
- **Validation is the crash guard.** A `startCompanions` failure after reload
  **exits the process**, so `Config.Validate()` must reject anything that
  would fail companion construction: trigger type/template/regex/cron,
  channel privateKey hex, duplicate companion names (the API routes and the
  runtime registry still key by name, so names must be unique even though
  storage keys by id), mqtt node references, broker fields.
  `configMutate` runs this on the assembled config before persisting.
  `TriggerConfig.Validate` parse-checks templates with stubbed trigger funcs
  (`formatPathBytes`) — extend the stubs if the templater gains functions.
- **`GET /api/health` is the monitoring endpoint**, shaped for Uptime Kuma and
  friends rather than for a person. It **always answers 200 while the process is
  alive**, including when the radio is not: a monitor that cannot reach OwlShack
  already fails the request, so the status code is not spent on a second
  opinion. `problems` is a possibly-empty array of binary faults in what the
  node cannot work without, and `status` is `ok` exactly when it is empty. The
  whole list: the modem not connected, or a companion or the repeater failing to
  start (which closes a modem that was fine, so it is named as such); the board
  not answering for `modem.AnswerDeadline()`; transmit failing (at least three
  sends in a row, for two minutes, the shape a lost `TX_DONE` leaves); no node
  running; and the database's disk under 32 MiB free. MQTT has its own verdict in `mqtt`: `status` is `ok`
  when every enabled broker is connected, `degraded` with a `problems` entry per
  one that is not, and `off` when none is enabled, because a broker being down
  loses uploads to the map, not the node, and should not page whoever watches
  the radio. Everything else is a fact to threshold externally, never a verdict. Three
  radio ages are kept apart on purpose: `lastReplySecs` is the liveness probe's
  own signal (the board answering a query, an error reply included, which a quiet
  mesh does not move, carried across a reconnect since reconnecting never waits
  for an answer; a board that has not answered yet counts from when the first
  unanswered link connected, so one hung before its first answer is caught too;
  KISS answers status queries, openHop its STATUS, and SPI has no board to ask),
  `lastRxSecs` is mesh traffic, and `lastTxSecs` is our own sends (a frame
  written to the modem, whatever the board then made of it; `txFailedInARow` and
  `txFailingSecs` say whether sends are actually going out). Each is
  `null` rather than `0` when there is nothing to measure from, so "cannot say"
  is distinguishable from "just now". `database.writesDroppedLastSecs` is the
  database signal to threshold. The `WriteAsync` overflow is otherwise silent —
  the write vanishes and every surface downstream still looks healthy — but the
  raw `writesDropped` count only ever rises, so it cannot tell "failing now"
  from "had a bad minute last Tuesday". A past loss is deliberately **not** put
  in `problems`, which would pin the endpoint to `degraded` for the life of the
  process after one transient overflow. `writeQueueLen` is a point sample of a
  queue that normally drains in microseconds, so it reads 0 unless the writer is
  *sustainedly* behind and will not catch a brief spike. `walBytes` is the
  write-ahead log's size on disk: a checkpoint trims it back to 4 MiB, so a
  value that keeps climbing means checkpoints are not completing, which nothing
  else would show. `diskFreeBytes` is there because a full disk fails every
  write inside the writer, which drops nothing and so shows nowhere else; it is
  `null` where the platform cannot say. **It is written on the
  assumption it may be public**: the running nodes are not listed at all — a
  name or pubkey is on-air already, but published on the internet it ties a
  hostname to a mesh identity that public maps resolve to coordinates — there is
  no position, and a broker reports
  `connectedSecs` / `lastErrorSecs` rather than the transport error, which would
  name a private broker's host and port. Both are ages for the same reason the
  radio's are: `connected` is a sample, so a broker reconnecting every thirty
  seconds reads `true` on nearly every scrape and only a connection age resetting
  to near zero reveals the flapping. `lastErrorSecs` is null once a connection
  has no error of its own. Leaving the nodes out costs
  nothing: peer counts are hydrated from SQLite and only grow, so they read the
  same with the antenna unplugged, and a node that fails to start exits the
  process rather than quietly leaving a list. "No node is running at all" is the
  only state worth reporting and it is a `problems` entry. That
  is a property of this endpoint alone — the rest of the API is unauthenticated
  and must not be exposed with it. It also never polls the board: board readings
  come from `StatsProvider.CachedStats`, not `Stats`, so a scrape costs no
  airtime and no 500ms wait. `GET /api/radio/status` still polls, which is why
  it takes ~500ms — that one is a diagnostics page a person is looking at.
- **Feed triggers (`rss`, `cap`) poll `triggers.url`** on `triggers.schedule`,
  which unlike `cron` may be blank and then defaults to `@every 5m`. The bot
  editor writes that column as a number and a unit (`@every 15m`) rather than a
  cron expression, and `validateFeedSchedule` floors any `@every` at one
  minute — a crontab spec has no seconds field, so a minute is already its
  finest step and only the descriptor form can ask for less. Each new
  item goes to every channel in `trigger_channels` *and* as a DM to every
  pubkey in `triggers.contacts` — the same column the `dm` type uses to filter
  senders, read here as recipients. At least one of the two is required: with
  neither, the trigger can never say anything. The first poll after a start only
  records what is already published, so a restart never replays a backlog onto
  the mesh, and one poll sends at most five items, the newest, counted as they
  are sent — a feed that republishes itself would otherwise queue dozens of
  transmissions onto a duty-cycled radio. A `cap` trigger fetches the alert
  document each entry links to; a 4xx or unparseable document is recorded as
  seen rather than refetched every poll. It sends an alert once however many
  entries post it (Meteoalarm posts one per area: 57 entries for 2 alerts in
  Germany's feed), skipping an entry whose message it has already handled, until
  a day past the alert's expiry. A message is named as CAP 1.2's `<references>`
  names one, by sender, identifier and sent, so an Update or Cancel (a new
  identifier) is sent even when it is served at the same link. Documents are
  cached for one poll only, so 47 entries cost one fetch but an update at the
  same link on a later poll is fetched fresh. A message is marked handled only
  once sent, so a copy that fails the filters cannot hide one that passes. One
  poll fetches at most 20 alert documents, each with its own 15 s timeout, and
  leaves the rest for the next poll. An entry whose document was already in the
  feed when the bot started, for a message sent before then, is backlog and is
  not sent. The Test lists each alert once.
  Templates get flattened conveniences (`.Title`/`.Link` for rss,
  `.Severity`/`.Headline`/`.Areas` for cap) plus the parsed structs themselves:
  `.Item` (`*gofeed.Item`) on both, and `.Alert`/`.Info` (`*cap.Alert`) on cap.
  Match patterns on a feed trigger are **field-scoped**, written
  `<field>:<regex>` (`severity:^(Extreme|Severe)$`). Patterns naming the same
  field are alternatives; different fields must all match, which is the pairing
  regex alone cannot express — alternation already says OR inside one field.
  `matchFields` in `internal/config/feedfields.go` is the vocabulary and
  `TriggerConfig.Validate` rejects an unscoped or misspelt field rather than
  compiling it as a bare regex that silently never matches. A field holding
  several values (`area`, `category`, `geocode`) joins them one per line, so an
  anchor needs `(?m)`. `geocode` is every area's `<valueName>=<value>`, for
  publishers that name areas by code instead of drawing them: on the NWS feed 89%
  of alerts (marine, coastal, wind) carry only zone codes, so
  `geocode:(?m)^UGC=TX` is Texas, and Meteoalarm's German, Spanish and Italian
  feeds carry only `EMMA_ID`/`WARNCELLID` codes. A cap entry's link typed
  `application/cap+xml` is fetched in preference to its first link, which on
  Meteoalarm is a web page.
- **Where a `cap` trigger's alerts must be** is a point or a set of regions,
  never both, checked before the patterns against the polygons and circles in
  the rendered info block. A point is `triggers.location_lat`/`_lon`/`_radius_km`
  (`location: {lat, lon, radiusKm}`): an alert passes when it covers the point or
  comes within `radiusKm` (0-500). Regions are `triggers.location_regions`
  (`regions: [id, ...]`, newline-encoded): an alert passes when its overlap with
  a region is at least 10% of whichever is smaller, the alert or the region,
  which keeps a warning drawn along a district line out of the neighbour it
  spills a sliver into. `null` for both takes alerts from anywhere, and `[]` is
  refused. An alert with no shape never passes either: a publisher that sends
  none never will. The bot Test reports it as `placement` (`anywhere`, `inside`,
  `outside`, `noShape`).
- **Regions are Natural Earth's admin-1 boundaries** (public domain, every
  country), each ring simplified to 1/200 of its width but never past about
  1 km, so a city-state or an atoll keeps its shape, and embedded as
  `internal/region/regions.bin.gz` (2.2 MB, delta-encoded microdegrees, each
  region's exact area precomputed); `go generate ./internal/region`
  rebuilds it from the pinned release. A region's id is Natural Earth's
  `adm1_code` (`NZL-3398` is Auckland), since ISO 3166-2 codes repeat within it.
  The generator refuses to drop an id the current file has, since a bot naming
  it would stop loading. The data is decoded on first use (about 30 ms), and a
  region's edges are indexed by latitude band the first time it is tested, so
  checking an alert against Nunavut, the most detailed region, takes under 1 ms.
  **At release**, compare the pinned tag (`source` in `internal/region/gen/main.go`)
  with Natural Earth's latest release (`gh api
  repos/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/releases/latest --jq .tag_name`; v5.1.2 of
  May 2022 was the latest when this was written). To move to a newer one, change
  the tag, run `go generate ./internal/region`, and commit the new file with it.
  If the generator stops because ids are gone, those regions were renumbered or
  removed: a saved bot naming one would stop loading, so check whether any bot
  uses them before accepting with `go run ./gen -allow-removed regions.bin.gz`.
  The output is deterministic (sorted ids, fixed rounding, no gzip timestamp), so
  rerunning the generator on an unchanged tag must leave `git status` clean; if it
  does not, the committed file is stale.
- **Region scopes cascade like path hash size, one level deeper.** `settings.flood_regions`
  (JSON `[{name, parent}]`, parent `*` at the top, as `repeater.regions` holds it) is the list every picker offers and received floods are labelled from, with
  the repeater's relay regions; `settings.flood_scope` is the default (`everywhere` or
  `region:<name>`). `companions`, `companion_channels`, `companion_contacts` and `triggers`
  each carry `flood_scope` (`inherit` | `everywhere` | `region:<name>`, CHECKed), and
  `config.ResolveScope` takes the most specific that does not inherit: channel or contact, then
  companion, then settings; a bot's own comes before the channel or contact it posts to. An API save
  that changes a scope to a region missing from the Settings list is refused, and the Settings
  save refuses dropping a listed region still in use, naming its users. A scope left unlisted by an
  older build stays until changed, and loading never checks, so a stored config always starts. The API requires `floodScope` on every save that carries it; a config file that leaves it
  out inherits, except the repeater's, which is everywhere. `repeater.flood_scope` is its own (firmware `default_scope`): `everywhere` or one
  of `repeater.regions`, never inherited; picking one clears its deny flood and removing it resets
  the scope, as on firmware. Sends we build are scoped with `Packet.SetScope`; channel posts and DMs use the
  library's `Send*Scoped`. `messages.flood_scope` records what each message carried (`unknown` is
  a region not in the list, `unrecorded` predates it); packets are labelled on read.
  Our repeater finds a region as the firmware's `findByName` does, with a leading `#` ignored:
  `#nz` and `nz` are one region, so both in a list is a duplicate, and a home, parent, add, deny
  flood or remove naming either finds the stored one and keeps its stored name.
  Both lists nest by parent for organising only (matching ignores it), are validated alike (each
  parent listed or `*`, no loops), and every picker shows the tree. Removing a Settings region moves
  its sub-regions up to its parent; copying from our repeater brings its parents, less `*` and `$` names.
  **Discover nearby** (`app/region_scan.go`, outliving a reload) runs a zero-hop discovery for
  repeaters, then sends each an anon REGIONS request (type 0x01, direct, empty reply path, from the
  first companion) and retries once: the firmware answers only a direct one, and only 4 every 3
  minutes from anyone (`anon_limiter(4, 180)`), so a second retry would cost half that.
- **DM acceptance is `companions.dm_policy`** (`contacts` | `allowlist` |
  `anyone`, default `contacts`) with `companions.dm_allow` holding the
  allowlist's pubkeys newline-encoded, the same encoding `triggers.contacts`
  uses. The decision is `CompanionConfig.AllowsDMFrom`, applied in the
  companion's TxtMsg handler to plain DMs only: a CLI reply or room push is a
  response to a session we opened, so it is never gated. Changing either field
  restarts the companion, since `triggersOnlyChange` only spares a trigger-only
  edit — so the RX path reads them without a lock.
- **MQTT is top-level, one node, always named.** `Config.Mqtt` (`mqtt.nodeKind`
  is `companion`, the default, or `repeater`; for a companion `mqtt.node` names
  it; `enabled` nil = on). Stored as `mqtt_settings.node_kind` (migration 028,
  CHECKed) and `node_companion_id` (a real FK, ON DELETE SET NULL), resolved to
  the companion **name** in `assembleFromRows`, so renaming the feed node
  doesn't break the reference. Nothing falls back to "the first companion":
  028 writes the first companion's id into a companion feed that named none,
  an imported file naming no node stores its first companion, and a feed
  naming no running node publishes nothing (logged). `PUT /api/config/mqtt`
  requires `nodeKind`, and a `nodeCompanionId` for a companion feed whenever a
  companion exists; it refuses a repeater that isn't configured, a companion id
  that doesn't exist, an id with the repeater, and a companion feed with no
  companion while MQTT publishes (enabled, with an enabled broker). Any config
  write that would leave MQTT publishing with no node, such as enabling a
  broker, is a 422; one that finds it so already (an upgrade or a restore) is
  let through. Deleting the node that feeds MQTT is a 409 while it publishes;
  otherwise the choice is cleared. A backup restored without the repeater
  clears a repeater feed's choice the same way, or the config wouldn't load. Legacy per-companion
  `[companion.mqtt]` blocks are hoisted by `ApplyDefaults` on load, first one
  wins; `CompanionConfig.Mqtt` is otherwise unused. At runtime the app owns the
  one observer (`app/mqtt_feed.go`), built with the feeding node's name and
  identity, and rebuilds it only when the MQTT settings or that node change.
- **Broker topics are templates.** `broker.packetTopic` / `broker.statusTopic`
  take placeholders `{iata} {pubkey} {name}` (meshcoretomqtt's `{IATA}` /
  `{PUBLIC_KEY}` uppercase forms also resolve); empty = the old hardcoded
  `meshcore/{iata}/{pubkey}/<kind>`. The deprecated `topicPrefix` field is
  folded into explicit templates by `ApplyDefaults` (`migrateTopicPrefix`).
  Resolution is `resolveTopics` in `internal/mqtt/observer.go` — the LWT in
  `connectBroker` must use the same resolution as the live status publisher.
  Templates are validated in `BrokerConfig.Validate` (unknown placeholders,
  MQTT wildcards). **Broker connection state is surfaced**:
  `GET /api/mqtt/status` returns every *configured* enabled broker with
  `connected` (paho's `IsConnectionOpen`; its `IsConnected` stays true while
  reconnecting), `lastError`, `connectedTs`, and publish/drop counts; the
  MqttPage polls it every 5 s for the per-broker pill. It lists configured
  brokers rather than live clients on purpose — a broker that never connected
  must stay visible. **`lastError` is the current connection's**: a connect
  clears it, and each error records the client it came from, so an old client's
  error never shows as the new one's. **A token refresh closes the old session
  before dialling** (`refreshToken`, under `brokerClient.refreshMu`, which
  `doPublish` takes too, so publishes wait rather than drop): every client shares
  one ClientID, and a second session is a takeover, so the broker kicks the old
  one and publishes our offline will, and paho redials a kicked client at once
  (its first reconnect has no delay), so the two fight. **A failed initial connect retries** (`retryConnect`,
  5 s doubling to 5 min, guarded by `brokerClient.retrying`): paho's
  `SetAutoReconnect` only covers a client that connected at least once, so
  without it a broker that was down at startup stayed down until the process
  restarted. The same loop rescues a failed token-refresh reconnect, which
  otherwise stranded the broker until the next refresh tick (0.8 x token
  lifetime). `doPublish` skips a client without an open connection
  (`IsConnectionOpen`) and counts a drop: while reconnecting, paho discards a
  QoS 0 publish yet reports it sent, and holds a QoS 1 one for the full
  `publishWaitTimeout`, stalling the worker. `retryConnect` keeps
  `IsConnected`, so it stands aside while paho's own reconnect runs rather than
  dial a second session on the same ClientID. Per-broker auth: `token` (Ed25519 JWT from the node
  identity, username `v1_<pubkey>`, 10-min lifetime, minted fresh on every connect/reconnect via paho's `CredentialsProvider` plus a refresh tick) or `basic`
  (user/pass). The Add Broker modal has presets (`BROKER_PRESETS` in
  `MqttPage.tsx`) mirroring meshcoretomqtt's: LetsMesh US/EU, Waev A/B,
  MeshMapper — update there if upstream endpoints change.
- **`ChannelRef` JSON gotcha**: it implements `UnmarshalText` (TOML string
  form), which makes encoding/json demand a string — `ChannelList`'s
  `UnmarshalJSON` therefore decodes objects into a tag-equivalent anonymous
  struct. Don't "simplify" it back to unmarshalling `ChannelRef` directly;
  that breaks JSON config-file import and the legacy-blob migration. (The API
  no longer round-trips `ChannelRef` — triggers reference channels by id via
  `trigger_channels`.)
- **Companion identity** is the `companions.private_key` column (64-hex
  ed25519 seed; `pubkey` is a derived, cached column). On create with a blank
  key, `SaveCompanion` generates one (`config.GenerateSeedHex`); on update it
  inherits the stored key from the row snapshot when the write omits it, so an
  edit can never silently rotate a running identity (no more
  `inheritCompanionKeys` — each resource owns its secret-keep logic). Keys are
  never sent to the browser (`privateKeySet` boolean only). Legacy `keyFile`
  entries are read and inlined at file import (`MigrateKeyFiles`). **Renaming a
  companion is fully safe**: every per-companion table — config references
  (mqtt node id, trigger channels) *and* history (messages, contacts,
  conversation reads, blocked senders) — keys on the surrogate
  `companions.id`, not the name. The history tables carry an INTEGER
  `companion_id` FK (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) and the runtime threads the id via
  `CompanionConfig.ID` / `Companion.ID()`. The
  API keeps `{name}` in its URLs and resolves it to the id per request
  (`CompanionRepo.IDByName`, `Server.companionID`). `node_state.companion_id`
  is the lone exception: it stays a name (node-keyed, self-heals each poll).

## SPI board registry (`internal/modem/boards.json`)

One entry per radio hat, keyed by the name stored in `settings.spi_board`.
**Every entry is drivable** — a pin map nobody can complete or test does not go
in the file, because a listed board reads as a supported one. 15 boards today,
all SX1262 on a Raspberry Pi header.

**`verified`** is declared per board and required: `"hardware"` (run here on
the physical hat) or `"community"` (wiring transcribed from a vendor or
community list, never tested). The UI labels anything but `"hardware"` as
**unverified**, and `modem_sx12xx.go` logs a warning at startup. 4 of 15 are
`"hardware"`.

Two invariants back that up, and neither is a runtime rule:

- `TestBoardRegistryIsComplete` fails on an entry with no RF-switch control
  (neither `use_dio2_rf` nor `txen_pin`), which would transmit into a
  terminated switch and read as a quiet mesh.
- `gpio_chip` is a hard load error: periph resolves pins by name on the default
  chip, so a banked pin map would drive whatever header line happens to share
  the number. It is how a hat for a LuckFox Pico or another non-Pi board fails,
  loudly, instead of silently driving Pi pins.

## Backup & restore

Export/import so a non-technical operator can move a node to new hardware
without hand-copying `meshcore.db`. UI is `BackupWizard` (opened from
`BackupPanel` on Settings) for export, and `RestoreFromBackup` inside
`SetupWizard` for restore. Logic: `internal/app/backup.go` over
`internal/store/backup.go`.

- **Restore is first-run only, by design.** Applying a backup to a node that is
  already configured and on the air is what breaks: identities collide,
  contacts half-overwrite, live sessions dangle. So the Settings panel is
  export-only and says where restore lives; the wizard's welcome step offers
  "Restore a backup" beside "Begin". **Don't add a restore button to Settings.**
- **A backup is a pruned copy of the database**, not a per-table dump:
  `VACUUM INTO` a temp file, `store.PruneBackup` deletes what the operator did
  not select, then `VACUUM` so the file actually shrinks (3.4 MB → 208 KB with
  history excluded). One format, and it restores through the whole-file swap.
  Companion pruning relies on `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so `PRAGMA foreign_keys`
  must be on in the copy — deleting a companion is what removes its channels,
  contacts and messages.
- **Restoring cannot overwrite the live file** (this process holds it open), so
  `StageRestore` writes `meshcore.db.restore` and `AdoptPendingRestore` (called
  from `Run` *before* `store.Open`) renames it into place on the next start,
  keeping the outgoing DB as `meshcore.db.replaced`. Its WAL is checkpointed
  into it first, so the one file holds the last writes before a crash; if that
  fails the WAL moves with it as `meshcore.db.replaced-wal`. Nothing of the old
  DB's `-wal`/`-shm` stays beside the adopted one, which it would corrupt. The
  API returns `restartRequired: true`.
- **The companion selection is always explicit.** `companionIds` is exactly
  what to keep: `[]` is none (a settings-only backup), every id is all. It is
  **required** — an omitted or `null` field is a 400, not a default, which is
  why the API DTO types it `*[]int64` and `decodeBackupOptions` fills in no
  defaults at all. Absent must never mean "all": a caller that forgets the
  field would silently get the largest possible backup, and the nil-vs-empty
  distinction does not survive re-serialization or a non-Go client. It keys on
  the surrogate id, not the name, like the rest of the config REST. An unknown
  id simply matches nothing.
- **Identity keys are opt-in** and govern `companions.private_key` /
  `repeater.private_key` only; channel keys are shared channel secrets, not
  identities, so they always travel. When excluded, `PruneBackup` blanks the
  columns and **`mintMissingKeys` (in `resolveConfig`) generates and persists
  new ones at startup** — required, because `Config.Validate` treats two blank
  keys as duplicates and would stop the process from starting.
- `POST /api/backup/estimate` counts what a selection captures using the same
  predicates `PruneBackup` deletes by, so the wizard can show what including
  the packet log costs before building the file. `Bytes` is the live DB size,
  i.e. an upper bound.
- **Day windows** are `-1` all, `0` none, or N days (`store.DaysAll` /
  `DaysNone`). They apply to `packets.received_at` and `messages.received_at`
  (unix ms, our clock: a sender's `timestamp` can be years out) and `node_metrics.ts` / `node_neighbors.ts` (unix seconds), hence
  the `sinceMS` and `sinceSecs` cutoffs in `backup.go`. Echoes go with their
  messages.
- **Import sniffs the upload**: the `SQLite format 3\0` magic means a backup
  (staged); anything else goes through `importConfigFile`, so an operator can
  also bring an old `.toml`/`.yaml`/`.json` config across through the UI. The
  filename only picks the parser.
- **A backup carries secrets** — channel keys, broker credentials, saved
  repeater passwords — so the export sets `Cache-Control: no-store` and both
  the wizard and the panel say so.
- **Import validates before touching anything**: `InspectBackup` requires a
  readable SQLite file with a `settings` table and `user_version <=`
  `LatestSchemaVersion()` (migrations never run backwards); a rejected upload
  leaves nothing staged.
- **An upgrade keeps a copy of the database first**: before migrating from
  version N to M, the store writes `meshcore.db.pre-vN-to-vM` with `VACUUM
  INTO` and syncs it, so going back to an older build is stopping OwlShack and
  moving the copy into place. An upgrade that fails part way keeps its copy,
  and the next start reuses it rather than copying the half-upgraded database;
  older copies are deleted only once an upgrade finishes. A copy whose `from` is
  the database's own version is not unfinished, as each file commits with its
  version bump: it is what a rollback by `cp` (not `mv`) left, so the upgrade
  copies afresh, writing beside it and renaming over it so a failed copy keeps
  it. Of two unfinished copies from one version, the one for the newer build
  wins. If the copy cannot be
  made (a full disk), the upgrade goes ahead without one and logs a warning, so
  an updated node still starts. Builds from this one
  on name the copy when they refuse a newer database (v1.4.x does not). Nothing
  is copied for a fresh database. Adopting a restore moves the live database's
  copies along with it (`meshcore.db.replaced.pre-vN-to-vM`) and deletes the
  older `.replaced` ones only when it replaces that database, as a finished
  upgrade's copy left behind would read as an unfinished one and the restored
  database would be upgraded uncopied. A copy that would land on an existing
  file refuses the restore, naming both, before anything moves.

## Packet log & the Map's Connections mode

- **The packet log is kept by age, not row count.** `settings.packet_retention_days`
  (Settings -> Service; `INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 7`, CHECKed 1-365, and required in
  `PUT /api/config/settings`, which refuses a missing or out-of-range value) is read by `packetPruneLoop`
  (`internal/app/packetlog.go`) at startup and hourly; saving it needs no reload.
  It deletes 500 rows per writer turn (`PacketRepo.PruneBatchBefore`) so a long
  backlog never fills the writer queue and drops RX writes. SQLite only reuses
  freed pages, so once a pass leaves a quarter of the file free (whatever freed
  it), `Store.ReleaseFreePages` gives them back to the disk 1024 pages per
  writer turn with `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum`. That needs `auto_vacuum =
  INCREMENTAL`, which `Open` sets with a single `VACUUM` before the writer
  starts, once per file (skipped, with a warning, when the disk lacks twice the
  live data). Not in the DSN: a DSN pragma runs on every pooled connection, and
  this one writes, which lost writes to "database is locked". **Never run a full `VACUUM` on the
  writer**: a trigger's reply calls `WriteSync` on the RX dispatch goroutine, so
  one long writer turn stalls RX.
- **`received_at` is UTC unix milliseconds**, like every time Go writes (see
  CLAUDE.md), so the prune is a batched `DELETE ... WHERE received_at < ?` and
  `ScanFloodRxSince` / `SentSince` take a `WHERE` range, all on
  `idx_packets_received_at`. A row stamped in the future by a wrong clock stays
  until it ages past the cutoff.
- **`GET /api/connection-web?hours=N&ownEchoes=bool`** (`routes_connection_web.go`) folds RX
  flood packets (not DIRECT, not TRACE, whose path holds SNR) into distinct
  routes ending at `"self"`. Hop hashes resolve to REPEATER peers only; colliding
  hashes pick the candidate nearest the next located hop toward us, else the most
  recently seen. Each node returns every repeater matching its hash as
  `candidates`. The source is only
  known for adverts. A path holding our repeater's hash is dropped as our own
  relay heard back only when a `tx` row in the window (plus a minute) has the
  same packet hash, so a foreign repeater sharing our hash is still drawn. A
  packet we started (a `tx` row with an empty path) is dropped whenever heard
  back, unless `ownEchoes=true`. Both filters run on read; the log keeps every row.
  SNR/RSSI belong to a route's last link only.
- **Hop pins** (`hop_pins`, `PUT|DELETE /api/connection-web/pins/{hash}`) let the
  operator settle a hash: a pubkey overrides the distance pick, a null pubkey says
  none of the known repeaters (the real relay never adverted), and DELETE returns
  it to automatic. Pins apply during resolution, not after, because each pick is
  what the next hop out measures from. A pin to a deleted peer falls back to
  automatic; a backup without peers drops the pins too.
- `first` counts, per packet hash, the lowest-id copy: which route won the race.
  The Map page's Connections mode (`?mode=connections`, `&own=1` for
  `ownEchoes`; `hooks/useConnectionWeb.ts` draws on the Map's own Leaflet
  instance, `components/ConnectionWeb.tsx` holds the toolbar half, the lists and
  the sheet, `lib/connectionWeb.ts` the folding) fetches only while the mode is
  on, subscribes to `packets` only then, and derives links from
  the routes: width is `shareOut` (how often a node picks that hop), opacity is
  the packet count on a log scale, and colour is the last-hop SNR (grey when
  none was measured). Every link is dashed and drawn sender-to-receiver, so the
  `.meshcore-web-link` flow animation in `index.css` reads as direction; its
  keyframe offset must equal the `LINK_DASH` period or the dashes stutter. The
  link sheet also shows `shareIn` (of what reaches the downstream node).
  Selecting a node keeps the whole routes it appears on, hops upstream of it
  included -- trimming them to the part after the node reduced a last-hop relay
  to a bare "R3 -> you" and hid where its traffic came from.

## Node monitoring

A type-agnostic poller (`internal/monitor`) polls monitored contacts on a staggered schedule → `node_metrics` (time-series) + `node_state` (latest snapshot, JSON `metric→value`). Gotchas:

- **Kind resolution is peer-type-first** (`monitorKind` in `internal/app/monitor_collector.go`): the advertised peer type wins when known; `metadata.isRepeater` is only the fallback for repeaters whose advert hasn't been heard. A stray `isRepeater` flag must never route a chat node to the repeater collector — companion firmware has no login handler, so that poll can only time out.
- **Companions are sessionless, telemetry-only.** `companionCollector` sends one `REQ_TYPE_GET_TELEMETRY_DATA` contact request (ECDH with the static identity — no login, no password). What comes back is gated by the *remote* node's telemetry-sharing prefs (base/location/environment, optionally per-contact flags) and requires the bot to be in its contacts. `MonitoringSettings` takes a `kind` prop ("repeater" | "companion") and hides password/probes for companions; its save only writes `isRepeater`/`repeaterPassword`/`monitorProbes` for the repeater kind. Chat contacts enrol via the monitoring panel on `ContactDetailPage`.

- **Metric keys are channel-faithful.** A node's *own* readings keep clean names (`mcu_temperature`, `battery`); *external* sensors carry their LPP channel (`temperature_ch2`, `humidity_ch3`) — the channel is the firmware's stable per-sensor identity on 1.16+. Status fields are fixed names (`last_snr`, `battery_mv`). Don't strip the channel to "unify" sensors — that makes multi-sensor identity order-dependent. Frontend tiles pattern-match by type (`metricKeysOfType` in `NodeStatTiles.tsx`), so they render whatever channel a board uses; `metricDef`/`metricOrderIndex` resolve `_chN` keys back to the base catalogue.
- **Firmware channel split:** ≤1.15 lumps all sensors on the self channel (ch1); 1.16+ gives each its own (ch2+). `parseRepeaterTelemetry` marks only the FIRST self-type reading on the self channel as the node's own (MCU temp/battery/location), the rest external — otherwise 1.15's external temp collides with the MCU temp under `mcu_temperature` and is lost. A 1.15→1.16 upgrade changes a board's channel keys (accepted one-off history discontinuity).
- **Snapshot merges, never blanks:** `UpsertNodeState` merges new readings onto the stored snapshot, so a partial poll (status OK, telemetry failed) keeps last-known values; a fully-failed poll uses `MarkPollFailure` (touches only `last_poll_ts`/`last_error`). Telemetry/neighbours probes retry once in-poll (`monitorProbeAttempts`).
- **Manual poll:** `monitor.Service.PollNow` (behind `POST /api/nodes/{pubkey}/poll`) runs an out-of-band poll, serialized against scheduled polls via `pollMu.TryLock` (returns "a poll is already in progress" rather than racing the radio).
- **Overview staleness dot** derives from each node's configured interval, not a constant: stale when `age > interval + max(25%, 5min)`. The interval is exposed per-node via `intervalSecs` on `/api/nodes/monitored`.
- **List membership is toggle-driven, not data-driven:** `/api/nodes/monitored` lists the poller's current target set (`monitor.Service.Targets()`, i.e. contacts with the monitor flag), merged with `node_state` snapshots where they exist. A freshly enrolled node appears immediately with `lastPollTs: 0` (UI shows a muted dot + "waiting for first poll"); toggling monitoring off hides a node even though its `node_state` row is retained. Don't go back to listing `node_state` rows directly — that hid new nodes until their first poll and showed unmonitored leftovers forever.

`?afterId=` was added in the recent UI rewrite. `internal/store/message.go` exports `ListAfter(companionID, channel, afterID, limit)` and `routes_messages.go` honours `?afterId=` to return messages with `id > afterID` ordered ASC. The frontend uses this for delta backfill on cache re-open and on WS reconnect.
